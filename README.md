#  HOSPITAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## 📍 PART 1: Problem Definition & Planning
### 🔹 1. Sector Focus: Health Sector 
Efficient healthcare delivery requires robust systems for managing hospital resources such as beds, staff, and medical equipment.

### 🔹 2. Problem Statement
Hospitals often struggle to manage limited resources effectively, leading to service delays, overwhelmed facilities, and inefficient care delivery.
Manual or disjointed tracking systems contribute to misallocation, underutilization, and lack of transparency in resource management.

This project proposes the development of a centralized, data-driven hospital resource management system to monitor, allocate, and optimize resources in real-time.
The system aims to enhance coordination, improve responsiveness, and ultimately boost the overall quality of healthcare services.

### 🔹 3. Dataset Description

. Dataset Title: 	COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State (RAW)

. Source link: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/6xf2-c3ie/data_preview

. Rows: 55

. Columns:	135

. File Format: 	Structured (CSV, Excel)

. Data Status	: Requires Cleaning and Transformation

## 📍 PART 2: Python Analytics Setup
🔹This section involves cleaning and analyzing the dataset using Python, with a focus on:

🔹Removing missing and irrelevant data

🔹Analyzing trends in bed utilization, ICU capacity, and COVID-19 impact

🔹Preparing the dataset for Power BI visualizations
